# In second year computer engineering class, group A studentâ€™s play cricket, group B students play badminton and group C students play football. 
# Write a Python program using functions to compute following: - 
# a) List of students who play both cricket and badminton 
# b) List of students who play either cricket or badminton but not both 
# c) Number of students who play neither cricket nor badminton 
# d) Number of students who play cricket and football but not badminton. 
# (Note- While realizing the group, duplicate entries should be avoided, Do not use SET built-in functions)
